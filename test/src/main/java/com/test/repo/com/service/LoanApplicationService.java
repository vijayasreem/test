Here is the Spring Boot service class corresponding to the given repository:

```java
package com.test.repo.com.service;

import com.test.repo.com.model.LoanApplication;
import com.test.repo.com.repository.LoanApplicationRepository;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class LoanApplicationService {
    
    private final LoanApplicationRepository loanApplicationRepository;
    
    @Autowired
    public LoanApplicationService(LoanApplicationRepository loanApplicationRepository) {
        this.loanApplicationRepository = loanApplicationRepository;
    }
    
    public LoanApplication findByLoanId(String loanId) {
        return loanApplicationRepository.findByLoanId(loanId);
    }
    
    // You can add more service methods here if needed
    
}
```

In this service class, we have autowired the `LoanApplicationRepository` interface using constructor injection. The `findByLoanId` method delegates the call to the repository method to retrieve the loan application details based on the Loan ID.

You can add more service methods to this class if needed, based on your specific requirements.
