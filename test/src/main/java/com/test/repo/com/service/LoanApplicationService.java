Sure! Here's an example of a Spring Boot Service class for the given repository:

```java
package com.test.repo.com.service;

import com.test.repo.com.model.LoanApplication;
import com.test.repo.com.repository.LoanApplicationRepository;
import org.springframework.beans.factory.annotation.Autowired;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Service;

@Service
public class LoanApplicationService {
    
    private final LoanApplicationRepository loanApplicationRepository;

    @Autowired
    public LoanApplicationService(LoanApplicationRepository loanApplicationRepository) {
        this.loanApplicationRepository = loanApplicationRepository;
    }

    // Add your service methods here
    
    public LoanApplication findByLoanId(String loanId) {
        return loanApplicationRepository.findByLoanId(loanId);
    }

    // Add any additional service methods required for your application
    
}
```

In this example, the `LoanApplicationService` class is annotated with `@Service` to mark it as a Spring Bean. The `LoanApplicationRepository` is injected into the service class using constructor injection.

You can add your own service methods to perform business logic or call methods from the repository. The example includes a method `findByLoanId` that delegates to the corresponding method in the repository.

Remember to adjust the package name and imports according to your project's structure.
