Sure! Here is an example of a Spring Boot entity/model class with the package name `com.test.repo.com.model` for the given repository:

```java
package com.test.repo.com.model;

import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.GeneratedValue;
import javax.persistence.GenerationType;
import javax.persistence.Id;

@Entity
public class LoanApplication {
    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;
    
    private String loanId;
    private String applicantName;
    // Add other fields as per your requirements
    
    // Constructors, getters, and setters
    
    public LoanApplication() {
    }
    
    public LoanApplication(String loanId, String applicantName) {
        this.loanId = loanId;
        this.applicantName = applicantName;
    }
    
    // Getters and Setters
    
    public Long getId() {
        return id;
    }
    
    public void setId(Long id) {
        this.id = id;
    }
    
    public String getLoanId() {
        return loanId;
    }
    
    public void setLoanId(String loanId) {
        this.loanId = loanId;
    }
    
    public String getApplicantName() {
        return applicantName;
    }
    
    public void setApplicantName(String applicantName) {
        this.applicantName = applicantName;
    }
    
    // Other getters and setters for additional fields
}
```

In this example, the `LoanApplication` class is annotated with `@Entity` to specify that it is a JPA entity. It has fields for the loan ID and applicant name, along with their respective getters and setters.

The `@Id` annotation is used to mark the `id` field as the primary key, and the `@GeneratedValue` annotation with `GenerationType.IDENTITY` strategy is used to generate unique IDs automatically.

You can add additional fields, constructors, and methods as per your requirements.
