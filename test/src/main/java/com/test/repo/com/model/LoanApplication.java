Here is the Entity/Model class with the package name `com.test.repo.com.model` for the given repository:

```java
package com.test.repo.com.model;

import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.GeneratedValue;
import javax.persistence.GenerationType;
import javax.persistence.Id;

@Entity
public class LoanApplication {

    @Id
    @GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)
    private Long id;
    
    private String loanId;
    
    // Add more fields as per your requirements
    
    public LoanApplication() {
        // Default constructor
    }
    
    // Add getters and setters for all the fields
    
    public Long getId() {
        return id;
    }
    
    public void setId(Long id) {
        this.id = id;
    }
    
    public String getLoanId() {
        return loanId;
    }
    
    public void setLoanId(String loanId) {
        this.loanId = loanId;
    }
    
    // Add more getters and setters for the additional fields
    
}
```

Make sure to replace `com.test.repo.com.model` with the actual package name for your model class. This entity/model class represents a loan application with fields such as `id` and `loanId`. You can add more fields as per your requirements and also include their respective getters and setters.
