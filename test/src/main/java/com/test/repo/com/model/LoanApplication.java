Here is the corresponding Entity/Model class for the repository:

```java
package com.test.repo.com.model;

import javax.persistence.Column;
import javax.persistence.Entity;
import javax.persistence.Id;
import javax.persistence.Table;

@Entity
@Table(name = "Loan_Application__c")
public class LoanApplication {

    @Id
    @Column(name = "Loan_Id__c")
    private String loanId;

    // Add other fields and their respective annotations

    public String getLoanId() {
        return loanId;
    }

    public void setLoanId(String loanId) {
        this.loanId = loanId;
    }

    // Add getters and setters for other fields

}
```

In this class, we annotate it with `@Entity` to indicate that it is a persistent entity. We also specify the table name using `@Table` annotation and the column name for the `loanId` field using `@Column` annotation.

Please note that you need to add other fields and their respective annotations based on the fields present in the `Loan_Application__c` object in Salesforce.
