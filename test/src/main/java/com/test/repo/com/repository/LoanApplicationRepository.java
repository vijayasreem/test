Here is an example of a Spring Boot repository with the required methods for the given technical user story:

```java
package com.test.repo.com.repository;

import com.test.repo.com.model.LoanApplication;
import org.springframework.data.jpa.repository.JpaRepository;
import org.springframework.stereotype.Repository;

@Repository
public interface LoanApplicationRepository extends JpaRepository<LoanApplication, Long> {
    LoanApplication findByLoanId(String loanId);
}
```

In this example, the repository interface `LoanApplicationRepository` extends the `JpaRepository` interface, which provides basic CRUD operations for the `LoanApplication` entity.

The `findByLoanId` method is added to the repository interface to retrieve the loan application details based on the loan ID entered by the user. This method uses Spring Data JPA's query creation feature to automatically generate the query based on the method name.

Please note that you will need to create the `LoanApplication` entity class that represents the loan application details.
